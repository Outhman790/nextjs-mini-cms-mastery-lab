/**
 * HOME PAGE - Main Entry Point
 * =============================
 *
 * This is the root page of our application (corresponds to route '/').
 *
 * FILE LOCATION MATTERS IN NEXT.JS:
 * ----------------------------------
 * - src/app/page.tsx â†’ https://yourdomain.com/
 * - src/app/about/page.tsx â†’ https://yourdomain.com/about
 * - src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx â†’ https://yourdomain.com/blog/some-post
 *
 * This is Next.js's "file-based routing" - the file structure defines the URLs!
 *
 * COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * ---------------------------
 * This page component has ONE job: Data Orchestration
 *
 * What it does:
 * âœ“ Fetch data from the database
 * âœ“ Pass data to presentation components
 * âœ“ Handle the overall page structure
 *
 * What it doesn't do:
 * âœ— Render UI details (delegated to PageHeader, PostList, PostCard)
 * âœ— Style individual elements (components handle their own styling)
 * âœ— Complex business logic (keep it simple!)
 *
 * This is called "Smart vs Dumb Components" pattern:
 * - Smart Component (this page): Handles data and logic
 * - Dumb Components (PageHeader, PostList, PostCard): Just render UI

/**
 * SERVER COMPONENT (RSC)
 * ----------------------
 * This is a React Server Component because:
 * - No 'use client' directive at the top
 * - It's async (can use await)
 * - Runs only on the server
 *
 * Benefits:
 * 1. Direct Database Access - No API route needed!
 * 2. Zero Client JavaScript - This component doesn't add to bundle size
 * 3. Better Performance - Data fetching happens server-side
 * 4. Security - Database credentials never exposed to client
 * 5. SEO Friendly - Content is rendered on server (crawlers see it)
 *
 * In traditional React, you'd need:
 * - useEffect for data fetching
 * - useState for storing data
 * - Loading states
 * - Error handling
 * - API routes
 *
 * Server Components eliminate all of that! ðŸŽ‰

  /**
   * DATA FETCHING
   * -------------
   * We query the database directly using Prisma ORM.

   * PRISMA QUERY BREAKDOWN:

   * db.post.findMany({...})
   * â”œâ”€ db: Our Prisma client instance (from @/lib/db)
   * â”œâ”€ post: The model name from our schema (prisma/schema.prisma)
   * â””â”€ findMany: Method to fetch multiple records
   *
   * Query Configuration:
   *
   * 1. where: { published: true }
   *    - Filters results to only published posts
   *    - Drafts (published: false) are excluded
   *    - This is called a "WHERE clause" in SQL
   *
   * 2. include: { category: true }
   *    - Fetches related category data
   *    - Called "eager loading" or "joining"
   *    - Without this, category would be null/undefined
   *    - One query instead of N+1 queries (efficient!)
   *
   * 3. orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
   *    - Sorts results by creation date
   *    - 'desc' = descending (newest first)
   *    - 'asc' would be ascending (oldest first)
   *
   * 4. take: 10
   *    - Limits results to 10 posts
   *    - Like SQL's LIMIT clause
   *    - Later we'll add pagination for the rest
   *
   * TYPE ANNOTATION: Post[]
   * -----------------------
   * We tell TypeScript this is an array of Post objects.
   * - Provides autocomplete
   * - Catches type errors
   * - Makes code self-documenting

/**
 * ============================================================================
 * ISR (INCREMENTAL STATIC REGENERATION) CONFIGURATION
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHAT IS ISR?
 * ------------
 * ISR is a Next.js feature that allows you to create or update static pages
 * AFTER you've built your site, without rebuilding the entire site.
 *
 * Think of it like this:
 * - Your page is generated once (like SSG - Static Site Generation)
 * - BUT it can update itself automatically on a schedule
 * - Users get fast, cached pages
 * - Content stays fresh without constant rebuilds
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * -------------
 * 1. User requests the page â†’ Gets cached version (super fast!)
 * 2. If cache is older than 'revalidate' time:
 *    - User still gets the cached version (no waiting!)
 *    - Next.js regenerates page in background
 *    - Next request gets the fresh version
 *
 * This is called "stale-while-revalidate" pattern.
 *
 * RENDERING STRATEGIES COMPARISON:
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * 1. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) - Default in Next.js 15
 *    - Renders on EVERY request
 *    - Always fresh data
 *    - Slower (database query each time)
 *    - Use for: Real-time data, user-specific content
 *
 * 2. SSG (Static Site Generation)
 *    - Renders at BUILD time only
 *    - Super fast (just HTML files)
 *    - Never updates (unless you rebuild)
 *    - Use for: Blog posts, marketing pages, docs
 *
 * 3. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) - What we're using!
 *    - Renders at build time + revalidates periodically
 *    - Fast (cached) + Fresh (updates automatically)
 *    - Best of both worlds!
 *    - Use for: Blog feeds, product listings, news sites
 *
 * 4. CSR (Client-Side Rendering)
 *    - Renders in browser
 *    - Fetch data with useEffect
 *    - Use for: Dashboards, user-specific data
 *
 * NEXT.JS 15 CACHING CHANGES:
 * ----------------------------
 * Important! Next.js 15 changed default behavior:
 *
 * Next.js 14 (old):
 * - fetch() was cached by default
 * - Had to opt-out with { cache: 'no-store' }
 *
 * Next.js 15 (new):
 * - fetch() is NOT cached by default
 * - Must opt-in with { cache: 'force-cache' }
 * - OR use route segment config (like we do below)
 *
 * This change makes Next.js more predictable and easier to reason about!
 */

/**
 * REVALIDATE CONFIGURATION
 * -------------------------
 * By exporting 'revalidate', we tell Next.js:
 * "Cache this page, but refresh it every 60 seconds"
 *
 * The number is in SECONDS:
 * - revalidate = 60 â†’ Updates every 1 minute
 * - revalidate = 3600 â†’ Updates every 1 hour
 * - revalidate = 86400 â†’ Updates every 24 hours
 * - revalidate = 0 â†’ Never cache (equivalent to SSR)
 * - No revalidate export â†’ SSR (dynamic rendering)
 *
 * HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT VALUE:
 * -------------------------------
 * Consider:
 * 1. How often does your data change?
 * 2. How important is freshness vs speed?
 * 3. Your server/database load capacity
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Blog homepage: 60-300 seconds (1-5 minutes)
 * - Product catalog: 300-600 seconds (5-10 minutes)
 * - News site: 30-60 seconds
 * - Documentation: 3600+ seconds (1+ hour)
 * - User dashboard: 0 or no revalidate (always dynamic)
 *
 * For our blog CMS, 60 seconds is a good balance:
 * - New posts appear within 1 minute
 * - Database only queried once per minute (max)
 * - Users get instant page loads from cache
 */
export const revalidate = 60;

/**
 * OTHER ROUTE SEGMENT CONFIG OPTIONS:
 * ------------------------------------
 * You can also export these configs in page.tsx:
 *
 * export const dynamic = 'auto' | 'force-dynamic' | 'error' | 'force-static'
 * - Controls when the route is rendered
 * - 'force-dynamic' = always SSR (never cache)
 * - 'force-static' = always SSG (build time only)
 *
 * export const dynamicParams = true | false
 * - For dynamic routes like [slug]
 * - Controls if unknown paths should be generated
 *
 * export const fetchCache = 'auto' | 'default-cache' | 'only-cache' | 'force-cache' | 'force-no-store'
 * - Controls fetch() caching behavior
 *
 * export const runtime = 'nodejs' | 'edge'
 * - Controls where code runs
 * - 'edge' = Runs on Edge Runtime (faster, more locations, some limitations)
 * - 'nodejs' = Full Node.js runtime (default)
 *
 * For now, we only need 'revalidate' for ISR!
 */

/**
 * HOW TO VERIFY ISR IS WORKING:
 * ------------------------------
 *
 * 1. Build the application:
 *    npm run build
 *
 * 2. Start production server:
 *    npm start
 *
 * 3. Visit http://localhost:3000
 *    - First load: Page is generated
 *    - Next loads: Served from cache (instant!)
 *
 * 4. Change data in database:
 *    - Add/edit a post in Prisma Studio
 *    - Refresh page immediately â†’ Still see old data (cached!)
 *    - Wait 61+ seconds and refresh â†’ See new data!
 *
 * 5. Check build output:
 *    Look for:
 *    â—‹ / (ISR: 60 Seconds)
 *    This means ISR is working!
 *
 * DEBUGGING ISR:
 * --------------
 * If ISR isn't working:
 * 1. Make sure you're using production mode (npm start, not npm run dev)
 * 2. Development mode (npm run dev) always regenerates
 * 3. Check the build output for cache indicators
 * 4. Verify fetch requests don't have cache: 'no-store'

/**
 * ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON
 * =======================
 *
 * BEFORE (Monolithic):
 * --------------------
 * page.tsx (267 lines)
 * â”œâ”€ Types
 * â”œâ”€ Data fetching
 * â”œâ”€ Header rendering
 * â”œâ”€ Post list rendering
 * â””â”€ Post card rendering
 *
 * AFTER (Modular):
 * ----------------
 * page.tsx (100 lines) â†’ Data orchestration
 * â”œâ”€ types/post.ts â†’ Type definitions
 * â”œâ”€ components/home/PageHeader.tsx â†’ Header UI
 * â”œâ”€ components/home/PostList.tsx â†’ List layout
 * â””â”€ components/home/PostCard.tsx â†’ Card UI
 *
 * Benefits:
 * âœ“ Each file has single responsibility
 * âœ“ Components are reusable
 * âœ“ Easier to test
 * âœ“ Easier to maintain
 * âœ“ Easier to understand
 * âœ“ Multiple developers can work simultaneously
 * âœ“ Changes are localized
 *
 * KEY NEXT.JS 15 CONCEPTS:
 * ========================
 *
 * 1. FILE-BASED ROUTING
 *    - page.tsx in a folder creates a route
 *    - No need for react-router or similar
 *
 * 2. SERVER COMPONENTS (RSC)
 *    - Async components
 *    - Direct database access
 *    - Zero client JavaScript
 *
 * 3. DATA FETCHING
 *    - No useEffect needed
 *    - No loading states needed (for now)
 *    - Happens during server render
 *
 * 4. COMPONENT COMPOSITION
 *    - Build complex UIs from simple components
 *    - Props flow down the tree
 *    - Each component has clear responsibility
 *
 * 5. TYPESCRIPT INTEGRATION
 *    - Type-safe props
 *    - Type-safe database queries
 *    - Catch errors at compile time
 *
 * NEXT STEPS (Hour 2 & 3):
 * ========================
 * - Add ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
 * - Implement pagination
 * - Add loading states
 * - Create dynamic routes for individual posts
